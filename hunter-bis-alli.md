Skinnay's Classic Hunter Gear Lists (Alliance) ![](https://i.imgur.com/RL0HHcp.png)
=

- "True" BiS is the absolute best gear configuration given all the possible options. Often this doesn't give you a great picture of what you should be striving for, so realistic alternative sets are provided to plan for constraints that can occur with typical loot distribution.
- Stat weights and dps values are based on [Sixx's DPS sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BIlB2P1kyV_QdD4ULQzvZvS6hK6BDouUQkyHQzCvBGI/edit#gid=333718892) assuming [full buffs, consumables, and boss debuffs with 20/31/0 spec](https://imgur.com/a/wZ0sBj7), unless otherwise specified. These are of course subject to change with different variables.
- Gear lists are based on their general effectiveness against all raid bosses as opposed to being tailored for specific bosses, unless otherwise specified.

Pre-raid P4 
---
- The power of Trueaim Gauntlets is due to how weapon skill is calculated against lvl 63s and raid bosses specifically. You may want to use devilsaur set and less hit gear for dungeons and other purposes.

Phase 3

- The dps provided by 5/8 tier set bonuses is situational and cannot be quantified, so it is not included in the dps calculations, but should be taken into consideration.
- Replacing Elven Ring with Master Dragonslayer's Ring is a minor upgrade, but not really worth getting considering that it is easily replaceable, while the neck from the quest is PvP bis.
- Full T2 sets do not include the debuff in the listed DPS, but it contributes roughly **9 dps per hunter on average**, with large variance. i.e. ~90 dps for the 7 second duration of the buff with an average 10% uptime.

Melee weave rotation (work in progress)
===
- P3 and P4 assume [13/31/7](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/hunter/530002003-05251030513051-32002) spec, while P5 and P6 assume [20/31/0](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/hunter/53000200505-05251030513051), based on whether Slaying talents affect the raid bosses of those phases.

Key differences for gear configurations:
* Agility weight relative to AP is lower than for pure ranged.
* Hit is now split into 2 parts, where the ranged hit scope, ranged weapon skill, and ranged AP are a bit less valuable, and you can still get some value from melee hit past the ranged cap. (e.g. 37 AP per hit = 32 per ranged hit + 5 per melee hit).
* Strength and melee AP are worth a small amount.
