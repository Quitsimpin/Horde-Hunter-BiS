Skinnay's Classic Hunter Gear lists (Alliance)
=

- "True" BiS is the absolute best gear configuration given all the possible options. Often this doesn't give you a great picture of what you should be striving for, so realistic alternative sets are provided to plan for constraints that can occur with typical loot distribution.
- Stat weights and dps values are based on [Sixx's DPS sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BIlB2P1kyV_QdD4ULQzvZvS6hK6BDouUQkyHQzCvBGI/edit#gid=333718892) assuming full buffs, consumables, and boss debuffs with 20/31/0 spec, unless otherwise specified. These are of course subject to change with different variables and/or if the sheet is updated.
- Gear lists are based on their general effectiveness against all raid bosses as opposed to being tailored for specific bosses, unless otherwise specified.

Pre-raid

C. [Realistic, Trueaim](https://sixtyupgrades.com/set/eX7G4p9rF75sLKmXvhYKQb) - 745.5 dps


Phase 2.5

Phase 3
---
- Sets without 3/8 T2 assume that the bonus can be snapshotted and used.
- Sets with full T2 include the debuff as part of its total dps.
- Replacing Elven Ring with Master Dragonslayer's Ring is a minor upgrade, but not really worth getting.
- Doom's Edge is equivalent to Dragonfang Blade, so whichever one you can get your hands on works.
