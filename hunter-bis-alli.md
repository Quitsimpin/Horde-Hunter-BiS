Skinnay's Classic Hunter Gear Lists (Alliance) ![](https://i.imgur.com/RL0HHcp.png)
=

- "True" BiS is the absolute best gear configuration given all the possible options. Often this doesn't give you a great picture of what you should be striving for, so realistic alternative sets are provided to plan for constraints that can occur with typical loot distribution.
- Stat weights and dps values are based on [Sixx's DPS sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BIlB2P1kyV_QdD4ULQzvZvS6hK6BDouUQkyHQzCvBGI/edit#gid=333718892) assuming [full buffs, consumables, and boss debuffs with 20/31/0 spec](https://imgur.com/a/dht0IWm), unless otherwise specified. These are of course subject to change with different variables and/or if the sheet is updated.
- Gear lists are based on their general effectiveness against all raid bosses as opposed to being tailored for specific bosses, unless otherwise specified.


Normal Ranged rotation

##### Stat stick rankings (up to P4)
- Weapons with 2 values listed are with and without Zandalar buff increasing agility

| Weapon | Base | Kings | Zandalar |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hakkari MH / Fang of the Faceless / R14 | 62 |
| Brutality Blade | 58 | 60 | 64 |
| Core Hound Tooth | 54 |
| Doom's Edge / Dragonfang Blade | 42 | 46 | 53 |
| Dal'rend's set (averaged) | 42 |
| Ribsplitter of Agility | 39 | 42 | 47 |
| Bone Slicing Hatchet / WSG revered dagger | 34 | 38 | 43 |
| Tooth of Eranikus | 37 |
| 1% crit weapon | 34 |

Pre-raid P3

- I am not including PvP ranking gear as "pre-raid".
- Dal'rends > Ribsplitter of Agility > Bone Slicing Hatchet/Sentinel's Blade > Assassination Blade/Dawn's Edge

| ID | Gear set | DPS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | [True, Hit Scope](https://sixtyupgrades.com/set/cdgwxCbghC9LZpYPPYJhUi) | 786.9 |

| C | [Realistic, Devilsaur](https://sixtyupgrades.com/set/78uCDwHQntBQxS5EuBAM9W) | 784.4 |


Phase 3
---
- Replacing Elven Ring with Master Dragonslayer's Ring is a minor upgrade, but not really worth getting. If you do get Nefarian's head, choosing the neck from the quest will last you much longer for PvP.
- Doom's Edge is equivalent to Dragonfang Blade, so whichever one you can get your hands on works.
- Full T2 does not include the debuff in the listed DPS.

Phase 5

- Multi-shot and Aspect of the Hawk rank up
- If Sentinel's Chains Leggings isn't released yet, replacing it for T2 legs in D & E subtracts 2.8 dps.

Melee weave rotation
===
Key differences for gear configurations:
* Melee weapon progression is very streamlined and inflexible, and you aren't getting 2% hit from BiS weapons in p5-6. **Lok'delar / Barbarous Blade -> Dreadforge Retaliator -> Arcanite Reaper -> Ashkandi -> Barb of the Sand Reaver -> Eye of Nerub**
* Agility weight relative to AP is lower than for pure ranged.
* Hit is now split into 2 parts, where the ranged hit scope & ranged weapon skill are a bit less valuable than regular hit, and you can still get some value from melee hit past the ranged cap. (e.g. 28 AP per hit = 24 per ranged hit + 4 per melee hit). A similar dynamic happens with ranged/melee AP.
* Strength is worth a small amount. (6 str ~= 1 AP)


Pre-raid
---
- No difference except that the Trueaim set falls a little further behind the Devilsaur set, and you can upgrade Barb Blade to Dreadforge Retaliator, or Arcanite Reaper if you're willing to spend the money.


Phase 3
---
- Get Ashjre'thul and Ashkandi by any means necessary.

Phase 4
---
- If you can't get your hands on Ashkandi, Zin'rokh is a decent alternative (~3 less dps)
- Swiftness of Zanza makes you weave faster and clip less.
- The +7 Scope sets listed above now barely edge out Hit Scope sets, since you gain melee hit.
