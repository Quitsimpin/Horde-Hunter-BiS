Skinnay's Classic Hunter Gear Lists (Alliance) ![](https://i.imgur.com/RL0HHcp.png)
=

- "True" BiS is the absolute best gear configuration given all the possible options. Often this doesn't give you a great picture of what you should be striving for, so realistic alternative sets are provided to plan for constraints that can occur with typical loot distribution.
- Stat weights and dps values are based on [Sixx's DPS sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BIlB2P1kyV_QdD4ULQzvZvS6hK6BDouUQkyHQzCvBGI/edit#gid=333718892) assuming [full buffs, consumables, and boss debuffs with 20/31/0 spec](https://imgur.com/a/dht0IWm), unless otherwise specified. These are of course subject to change with different variables and/or if the sheet is updated.
- Gear lists are based on their general effectiveness against all raid bosses as opposed to being tailored for specific bosses, unless otherwise specified.

Pre-raid P3
---
- I am not including PvP ranking gear as "pre-raid".

| ID | Gear set | DPS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | [True, Hit Scope](https://sixtyupgrades.com/set/cdgwxCbghC9LZpYPPYJhUi) | 786.9 |
| B | [Realistic, Trueaim](https://sixtyupgrades.com/set/eX7G4p9rF75sLKmXvhYKQb) | 785.3 |
| C | [Realistic, Devilsaur](https://sixtyupgrades.com/set/78uCDwHQntBQxS5EuBAM9W) | 784.4 |


Phase 3
---
- The dps provided by 5/8 set bonuses is situational and cannot be quantified, so it is not included in the dps calculations, but should be taken into consideration.
- Replacing Elven Ring with Master Dragonslayer's Ring is a minor upgrade, but not really worth getting. If you do get Nefarian's head, choosing the neck from the quest will last you much longer for PvP.
- Doom's Edge is equivalent to Dragonfang Blade, so whichever one you can get your hands on works.
- Full T2 does not include the debuff in the listed DPS.

Melee weave rotation
===
Key differences for gear configurations:
* Melee weapon progression is very streamlined and inflexible, and you aren't getting 2% hit from BiS weapons in p5-6. **Lok'delar / Barbarous Blade -> Dreadforge Retaliator -> Arcanite Reaper -> Ashkandi -> Barb of the Sand Reaver -> Eye of Nerub**
* Agility weight relative to AP is lower than for pure ranged.
* Hit is now split into 2 parts, where the ranged hit scope, ranged weapon skill, and ranged AP are a bit less valuable, and you can still get some value from melee hit past the ranged cap. (e.g. 37 AP per hit = 32 per ranged hit + 5 per melee hit).
* Strength and melee AP are worth a small amount. (6 str ~= 1 AP)

| Weapon | DPS |
| --- | --- |
| Barbarous Blade | Baseline |
| Lok'delar / Peacemaker | +3 |
| Spinal Reaper | +7 |
| Dreadforge Retaliator | +9 |
| Huntsman's Harpoon | +12 |
| Arcanite Reaper | +15 |
| Zin'rokh | +21 |
| R14 2H | +23 |
| Ashkandi | +24 |
| Gri'leks Carver (Dragonkin) | +31 |
| Barb of the Sand Reaver | +33 |
| Eye of Nerub | +40 |

Phase 3
---
- Get Ashjre'thul and Ashkandi by any means necessary.

Phase 4
---
- If you can't get your hands on Ashkandi, Zin'rokh is a decent alternative (~3 less dps)
- Swiftness of Zanza makes you weave faster and clip less.
- The +7 Scope sets listed above now barely edge out Hit Scope sets, since you gain melee hit.
