Alliance Hunter Gear Lists
=

- "True" BiS is the absolute best gear configuration given all the possible options. Often this doesn't give you a great picture of what you should be striving for, so realistic BiS alternative sets are provided to plan for constraints that can occur with typical loot distribution.
- Stat weights are based on Sixx's DPS sheet assuming full buffs, consumables, and boss debuffs with 20/31/0 spec, unless otherwise specified. These are of course subject to change with different variables and/or if the sheet is updated.
- Gear lists are based on their general effectiveness against all raid bosses as opposed to being tailored for specific bosses, unless otherwise specified.

- Replacing Elven Ring with Master Dragonslayer's Ring is a minor upgrade, but not really worth getting.
- Doom's Edge is equivalent to Dragonfang Blade, so whichever one you can get your hands on works.
